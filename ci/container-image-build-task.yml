# task that builds docker images with an option to specify a target platform.

# After that command runs, you should have an `image/image.tar` oci image that you can test with:
  # docker load -i image/image.tar
  # docker tag LOADED_IMAGE_ID instana-agent-docker-s390x:local
  # docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh instana-agent-docker-s390x:local # this won't run if you are not on an s390x machine.
